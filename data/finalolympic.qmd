```{r}
#uploading code#
olympics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-08-06/olympics.csv')

#adding associated packages#
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
library(broom)
```

```{r}
#creating a table using gtsummary with appropiate captions#

#| label: tbl-descr
#| tbl-cap: "Descriptive statistics"

tbl_summary(
	olympics,
	by = year,
	include = c(year, weight, height
	)
)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
# fit a univariate regression#

	tbl_uvregression(
		olympics,
		x = medal,
		include = c(
			 year,weight,height
		),
		method = lm
	)
```

```{r}

#create a figure

hist(olympics$year)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
